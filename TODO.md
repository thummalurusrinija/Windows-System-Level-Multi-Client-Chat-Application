# Server-to-Server Communication Implementation

## Overview
Adding server-to-server communication capabilities to enable multiple chat servers to communicate with each other, creating a distributed chat network.

## Phase 1: Core Server-to-Server Protocol âœ…

### 1.1 Create Protocol Header Files
- [x] Create `interserver_protocol.h` - Define message types and protocol structures
- [x] Create `server_config.h` - Server configuration management
- [x] Create `server_manager.h` - Server connection management

### 1.2 Implement Server Discovery System
- [x] Add server registry to track connected servers
- [x] Implement server handshake protocol
- [x] Add server connection management to main server

### 1.3 Basic Message Forwarding
- [x] Add message routing between servers
- [x] Implement server-to-server message types
- [x] Add basic server authentication

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### 2.1 Enhanced Server Features
- [ ] User presence synchronization across servers
- [ ] Cross-server user listing
- [ ] Server load balancing capabilities

### 2.2 Server-to-Server Commands
- [ ] Connect to other servers command
- [ ] List connected servers command
- [ ] Send messages to other servers
- [ ] Server status and statistics

### 2.3 Enhanced Message Routing
- [ ] Server-to-server private messaging
- [ ] Message broadcasting across server network
- [ ] User routing between servers

## Phase 3: Enhanced Client Support

### 3.1 Client Updates
- [ ] Update client to show which server users are on
- [ ] Add server selection capabilities
- [ ] Cross-server messaging support

### 3.2 Client Commands
- [ ] Show connected servers
- [ ] Switch between servers
- [ ] Cross-server user messaging

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files Created:
- [x] `interserver_protocol.h` - Server-to-server communication protocol
- [x] `server_config.h` - Server configuration management
- [x] `server_manager.h` - Server connection management
- [x] `TODO.md` - This tracking file

### Files to Modify:
- [x] `server.cpp` - Add server-to-server communication features
- [ ] `client.cpp` - Update to work with multi-server system
- [ ] `Makefile` & `build.bat` - Update build scripts

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1 Testing:
- [ ] Test server-to-server connection establishment
- [ ] Test basic message forwarding between servers
- [ ] Test server registration and discovery
- [ ] Test server disconnection handling

### Phase 2 Testing:
- [ ] Test user presence synchronization
- [ ] Test cross-server user listing
- [ ] Test server administration commands
- [ ] Test load balancing features

### Phase 3 Testing:
- [ ] Test client connection to multiple servers
- [ ] Test cross-server messaging
- [ ] Test server switching capabilities
- [ ] Test network stability with multiple servers

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Core Implementation: IN PROGRESS**

Next Steps:
1. Complete Phase 1 implementation
2. Test basic server-to-server communication
3. Move to Phase 2 advanced features
